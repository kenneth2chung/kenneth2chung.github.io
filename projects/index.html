        <h4>Benchmarking Large Language Models for Path Planning on Discrete Grids</h4>
        <h5>October-December 2023</h5>
        <p>We explore the generalizability of LLMs on discrete path planning tasks, utilizing Chain of Thought reasoning and existing foundational models. These are finetuned on several novel discrete tasks, discussing trade-offs associated with each. Done as the final project for CS 6756 (Learning for Robot Decision Making). </p>
